Hey! I'm Troy, a web developer and musician based in Baltimore, currently an engineer at T. Rowe Price and part-time developer at Goucher College. My interests include internet privacy, open source software, and making the web a more accessible place. I also like long walks on the beach (but **hate** getting sand _everywhere_). Any and all opinions are my own. (I think I'm legally required to say that?)

In 2021, I became a community organizer for [charmCityJS](https://charmcityjs.org/), a Baltimore-based [JavaScript meetup](https://www.meetup.com/charmcityjs/). We meet on the first Wednesday of the month for a night of talks from the community, discussions on all things JS, and all around camaraderie with fellow devs.

If you'd like my professional history in detail, [view my résumé](https://resume.troyv.dev/). It's updated about as often as anyone else's (YMMV), but it looks nice and prints well. If you want to know what I'm up to _right now_, I have a [now page](/now).

The posts on my blog are usually focused on active projects - or the trials and tribulations of a new framework - because I believe it's important to learn in public. Not only is that a benefit for me, but if someone else is able to find use in a post of mine then I'd consider it all worth it.

This website is made with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and I reserve the right to change how it looks or what it's built on [whenever][1] [I want][2]; however, it's been on 11ty nearly since the beginning, and I love it so much that I don't see myself changing _that_ aspect any time soon.
