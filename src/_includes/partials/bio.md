I'm glad you could make it, please peruse my wares<sup>\*</sup>. I'm a developer and musician based in Baltimore who is interested in privacy, <abbr title="Open Source Software">OSS</abbr>, and making the web a more accessible place. Oh, and a community organizer for [charmCityJs](https://charmcityjs.org/), a [JavaScript meetup](https://www.meetup.com/charmcityjs/). I also like long walks on the beach, but can't stand getting sand everywhere.

You may [view my résumé](https://resume.troyv.dev/) if you'd like. It's updated about as often as anyone else's <abbr title="Your mileage may vary">(YMMV)</abbr>, but it looks nice and prints well. You can also [contact me directly](/contact/).

See what I'm doing on [GitHub](https://github.com/troyvassalotti) or follow me on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@rest).

This website is made with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and I [change it often][1].
