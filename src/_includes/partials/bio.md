I'm a developer and musician based in Baltimore who is interested in privacy, open source software, and making the web a more accessible place. I also like long walks on the beach, but can't stand getting sand _everywhere_.

In 2021, I became a community organizer for [**charmCityJs**](https://charmcityjs.org/), a Baltimore-based [JavaScript meetup](https://www.meetup.com/charmcityjs/) that meets on the first Wednesday of every month for a night of talks, discussions, and camaraderie.

If you'd like my professional history in detail, [view my résumé](https://resume.troyv.dev/). It's updated about as often as anyone else's <abbr title="Your mileage may vary">(YMMV)</abbr>, but it looks nice and prints well. You can also [contact me](/contact/).

Posts in the blog are focused on my projects and the trials and tribulations of engineering because I believe it's important to **learn in public**. If someone else is able to find use in a post of mine, then that's an added bonus.

This website is made with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and I [change it often][1].
