- Revisiting a back catalogue of [music I wrote](/music/) years ago but never finished. Trying to map out a third _troyalllowercase_ album amongst the stockpile.
- Absolutely exhausting Skyrim (PS4) for all it's worth since I can't progress the main quest due to a bug that makes Alduin never appear in the time wound.
- Being more mindful of the content I consume thanks to [this conversation](https://pca.st/ks4l8amb) between PJ Vogt and Ezra Klein.
- Debating on signing up for the Baltimore Half Marathon again this year. Last year I did a personal record of 1:57.
- Taking active care of the many plants in our home with the help of [Planta](https://getplanta.com/).
