# Now

Inspired by the [/now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about).

_Updated {{ page.date | dateString }}._

## Music

I've been writing and recording my second album for [troy.](https://justtroy.bandcamp.com) for many months now. That is, if you only count the time since I started tracking songs. The reality is a decent amount of the songs were written over many years, but not formally brought together to form an album until now.

## Code

Since June 2021, I've been working on the for [Digital Humanities Lab](https://humanitieslab.goucher.edu/) for Goucher college. It's a fun project involving a variety of people working together to archive the projects and research of the arts department.

## Reading

I'm currently reading [_Underworld_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underworld_(novel)) by Don DeLillo. It's a massive book - probably the most pages I'll ever read. I recently read his novel _White Noise_ and enjoyed it, leading me to purchase _Underworld_ at a local bookstore.
