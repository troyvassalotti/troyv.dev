- Revisiting a back catalogue of [music I wrote](/music/) years ago but never finished. Trying to map out a third _troyalllowercase_ album amongst the stockpile.
- Playing through Far Cry 4 again and remembering just how much fun it is.
- Being more mindful of the content I consume thanks to [this conversation](https://pca.st/ks4l8amb) between PJ Vogt and Ezra Klein.
- Taking a break from Instagram as a way to practice being more mindful.
- Debating on signing up for the Baltimore Half Marathon again this year. Last year I did a personal record of 1:57.
- Taking active care of the many plants in our home with the help of [Planta](https://getplanta.com/).
