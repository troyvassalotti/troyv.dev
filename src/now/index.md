Inspired by the [/now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Music

I've been writing and recording my second album for [troy.](https://justtroy.bandcamp.com) for many months now. That is, if you only count the time since I started tracking songs. The reality is a decent amount of the songs were written over many years, but not formally brought together to form an album until now.

## Code

Since June 2021, I've been working on the for [Digital Humanities Lab](https://humanitieslab.goucher.edu/) for Goucher college. It's a fun project involving a variety of people working together to archive the projects and research of the arts department.

Lately, I've been jotting down notes on how I want to improve the website you're looking at now. Don't get me wrong - I love what I've managed to make here, but it's been nearly two years since the current design was launched. I'm ready to branch out of my comfort zone while trimming the unnecessary bits of code here and there. Maybe I'll dive deeper into Eleventy's `_data` folder.

I'm reminded of this blog from [Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/) (which I found via [Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com/)).

## Reading

I'm currently reading [_Underworld_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underworld_(novel)) by Don DeLillo. It's a massive book - probably the most pages I'll ever read. I recently read his novel _White Noise_ and enjoyed it, leading me to purchase _Underworld_ at a local bookstore.
