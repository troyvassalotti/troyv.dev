- Still taking a break from Instagram as a way to practice being more mindful.
- Reading [How To Do Nothing](https://bookshop.org/p/books/how-to-do-nothing-resisting-the-attention-economy-jenny-odell/8076119).
- Finding ways to consolidate in my life. My digital collections, my website, my closet, anything.
