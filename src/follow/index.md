Follow me [on Mastodon]({{metadata.follow.mastodon}}).

Since [all my notes](/notes/) are syndicated to Mastodon, you could subscribe directly to my notes feed:

- [Notes (Atom)](/notes.xml)
- [Notes (JSON)](/notes.json)

My [blog posts](/archive/) are also syndicated to Mastodon, but the full content doesn't publish because they are longer pieces. Subscribe to the blog feed:

- [Blog (Atom)](/feed.xml)
- [Blog (JSON)](/feed.json)
