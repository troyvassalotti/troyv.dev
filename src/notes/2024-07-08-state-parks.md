I made a goal earlier this year to visit all the state parks in Maryland (an easy choice since I live there). It's not a _this-year_ type of goal, but more of an _eventually_ goal. Last weekend I visited my fourth of the year, Gambrill State Park: <https://stateparks.troyv.dev/md/gambrill-state-park/>. It was the most difficult trail so far, but beautiful.
