<p>
    I use <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/user/actionhamilton">MusicBrainz</a> for tracking my music collection. It isn't a perfect system, but it gets the job done. Lists are in no particular order.

<article id="vinyl" class="vinyl flow">
    <section class="ownedVinyl flow">
        <h2>Vinyl</h2>
        <ul>
            {% for vinyl in musicLibrary.ownedVinyl %}
                <li>
                    <b>{{ vinyl.artist }}</b>:
                    <i>{{ vinyl.title }}</i>
                </li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>

    <section class="wishlist flow">
        <h2>The Wishlist</h2>
        <p>
            I <em>could</em> order these online but the point of this list is that I find them out in the wild. I don't even know if all of these have been pressed before, but I'm holding out hope.

            {% for vinyl in musicLibrary.vinylWishlist %}

                    <i>{{ vinyl.title }}</i>
