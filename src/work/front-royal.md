When we (Front Royal) decided to take the plunge and have a website of our own, I signed myself up to make it. It gave me the opportunity to try some new things out, and I'm always happy to jump in and make it better. I don't know how many bands create their website using the Jamstack; at first glance, most of them use Squarespace, WordPress, Shopify, or the like. Me being who I am, I spun up an Eleventy site a plain ol' static site with HTML, CSS, and JS, and went on my way.

Designs were completed in Figma before being templated out. The site is always evolving, but it's a fun and worthwhile project.
