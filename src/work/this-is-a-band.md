When I was looking for a domain to host my solo project, it was _on brand_ to purchase **thisisa.band**, but that name sparked a new idea: create a blog for people to talk about the bands they love. The premise is all collaborative as people are able to submit their own posts (for me to approve) on the site.

I started out with a [blog template](https://brevifolia-nuxt-forestry.netlify.com/) using [Forestry CMS](https://forestry.io). The plan is to contribute _most times_ and enhance the experience _a little more than sometimes_.
