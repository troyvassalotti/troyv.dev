I don't need to reiterate what 2020 is like. My friends and I, you may know us as Front Royal - the band, not the town - were sitting restless in our separate homes after the [release of our debut LP](https://frontroyalmd.bandcamp.com), so we decided to cover one of our favorite songs: _Sweet Talk_ by Dear and the Headlights.
