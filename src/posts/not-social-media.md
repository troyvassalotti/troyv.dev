description: Social media is overwhelming, which is why I quit using a lot of it, but that didn't stop me from creating my own app where I can enjoy it all alone.

We can all agree that social media is a lot to handle sometimes. I know I have a habit of scrolling on Reddit for far too long before I realize how long it's been, and it isn't isolated to Reddit. Twitter, Instagram, and the like are all in this bucket.

Since deleting myself from Facebook, I've realized a few things about myself and others, but that's not what this post is about. This post is about [NotSocial]({{ website }}).

NotSocial is my new passion; it's more than an app - it's an ideology. You may be thinking that this is exactly the problem that other social media platforms have: they become more than an app and grow into a cultural phenomenon, and I'm not here to tell you whether you're right or wrong.

But I am here to tell you how NotSocial is a new kind of social media platform where it is only you that exists in its world. It's a section of the internet for you - and only you - to be social with yourself while feeling connected with the rest of the world.

- Enjoy the thrill of Twitter while also being able to **wipe it off the face of your device screen.**
- Comment, like, and even dislike posts from your favorite news outlets, celebrities, and crazy relatives (bonus points if you reach the high score).
- See your direct messages, potentially play games (no promises), and look at dog pictures.

When you're all done, close your account without hassle, free of charge. I make it super simple to rid yourself of NotSocial because it should never be an inconvenience to delete yourself from an internet service.

## Give Me The Technical Details

NotSocial started out as a simple idea on [CodePen](https://codepen.io) practicing Vue. It was originally called _Pang_ because Merriam-Webster defines _pang_ as "a sharp attack of mental anguish," which is all social media is anyway.

> You can even [view the original NotSocial there](https://codepen.io/troyvassalotti/full/RwWLyBV) still. Be warned though, it's a little rough around the edges in terms of how Vue works and overall design.

I thought I was done after publishing that, but I knew it could be better. Not only could it be better looking and more thought out, but I could broaden my skills and [make it with Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), a static site generator for Vue. I knew it wouldn't be a walk in the park, but I didn't expect it to be as challenging as it was either.

You can take a look at my commit history if you want to; It's a little embarrassing, but funny. You can see the thought process going on as I struggled to make the site: "Wow, you gotta wrap everything in a div or whatever to make it work."

Long story short, it took me a few months to get this thing right. I had to read _a lot_ of Nuxt documentation to really, truly, understand what the heck I was doing, and it was worth it because NotSocial 2.0 is beautiful (to me, at least right now).

I learned a lot using Nuxt and Vue to make this faux-app. Both tools are incredibly useful for something like this, which I why I chose them instead of something like Hugo or Eleventy, two SSGs I use for separate projects.

After all this time though, it is still a fun side project. If I were to open up that folder in Atom right now, I would probably be overtaken with dread by the thought of having to update npm or something [a popular topic right now](https://css-tricks.com/npm-ruin-dev/). So, don't ask me to make any updates please.

## Lessons Learned

- Always read the documentation.
- Patience is a virtue.
- Maybe don't rely on npm for everything if you want to work on a thing long term.
