I'm cleaning up my site and realized I never made a post about [Gonk, a silly messaging service](https://gonk.app) I made. You may be wondering why it's called "Gonk." I, too, am wondering that. It's an inside joke from years ago at this point.

You may also be wondering what it is you can do on Gonk. Well, you send honks with Gonk, of course. What is a "honk?" A honk is a little note composed of a sound clip and a tweet-length message. Before you ask, NO you cannot upload your own sound to share. I have curated a fine selection of sounds to choose from. If you want more options, [contact me](/contact).

What are you waiting for? Go forth and send some honks.
