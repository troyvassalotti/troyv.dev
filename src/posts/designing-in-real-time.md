I recently learned how to use deploy contexts and multiple deploys within Netlify. It's always so fulfilling being able to take advantage of a new technology (_new_ relative to my brain).

Going along with that, I also learned the value of maintaining a stable development branch in GitHub on which to make changes.

All that said, you can watch me make changes to this site in real time by going on over to ~~nowhere~~.

Sure, you could keep coming back to my published site and looking around for changes. But I think it's fun to open up the development process.

It's not like it's a secret - you could look at the ~~open branch on the repository~~.

Maybe you see something I'm working on that you outright **hate**, and if that happens then I hope you @ me about it.

Have fun!
