Earlier this month, I gave a talk at [the charmCityJs meetup](https://www.meetup.com/charmcityjs/) about how I use the powers of Eleventy and Forestry to integrate my development workflow into a CMS. I had never given a talk before, let alone try to explain how my website works to people I barely know. That said, it was a cool 15 minute experience.

I'd been wanting to give a talk for the meetup in the past, but I never worked up the courage to submit an idea. Sure, I work with JavaScript all the time, but that doesn't necessarily mean I know enough about it to convince someone I know what I'm talking about.

But that's not what the meetup is about at its core. I'm not there to try and convince people of an idea; I'm there to present something I've been working on that I think is cool and that other people might also find cool. Being able to get in front of a community of like-minded people and talk about a thing we all enjoy (I use this term lightly in regards to JS) is a fun time.

I won't recap my entire talk from front to back, but here's the rundown:

1. I accidentally made my site complicated by trying out new features in the world of JS, specifically Eleventy.
2. I got tired of being distracted in my code editor when trying to make a blog post - or even forgetting what front matter fields are necessary for said post - so I needed a way to streamline the process.
3. Forestry was brought to my attention and I found it to be a nice companion to the way my site is structured.

I discussed a few of the Nunjucks features used in my templates, as well as how to use front matter to its fullest. The abbreviated talk can be [found on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/troyvassalotti/using-data-to-create-a-cms-with-forestry-and-eleventy). I'm looking forward to giving more talks in the future, and I encourage anyone else who's thinking the same thing to push through the imposter syndrome and give it a shot.
