Think about the last time you were out with friends or family and there were drinks in front of each of you. When slight breaks in a conversation happened, did you all reach for and take a drink at the same time in that moment of stillness? It's possible the venn diagram for _people reading this post_ and _people who have noticed this_ is two separate circles.

I imagine we instinctually take that time to collect our thoughts or attempt to transition topics so you don't encounter awkward silence. If the latter is the case, I also believe maybe awkward silences aren't that bad.
