I read [this post from Keenan](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/i-dont-need-to-know-what-my-favorite-songs-are-about-but-sometimes-it-helps) and _felt seen_.

From their post:

> When I listen to music, I can hear the individual words. I can sing along to the song (or at the very least reproduce close approximations to the sounds I hear). I can latch on to refrains. But interpreting meaning from any of this is, at best, a futile endeavor. I do find this strange, considering how deeply I feel music at an emotional level. But I form attachments to vibes, not linguistics.

Same!

They recount a story of putting Alien Ant Farm's "Attitude"[^1] on a mix CD for a girlfriend and being questioned about _why_ that song in particular.

> "'It seems like we need our own space'?" she wrote. "Are you trying to tell me something??"

I'm sure I've potentially walked myself into similar situations in the past.

Music has been a central focus of my entire life, having grown up with two musical older brothers who instilled upon me my entire music taste. Hell, I [write music](/music) quite often. But here's the thing: _I don't consider myself a lyricist and dread writing words to my own music_. It's the reason [my second album](https://troyalllowercase.bandcamp.com/album/lets-try-this-again) was instrumental. Believe me, I tried for a long time to put words to those songs. All it got me was a single song with words I was happy with that I'll be releasing sometime in the future.

The music is what ultimately spoke to me most. It always has been. I write the music first and the words that go over them are an afterthought. This is how it goes in [my band](https://www.frontroyalband.com) too. We share songwriting duties, but I've not contributed lyrics to them in all 10 years we've been together. It's not how my brain works.[^2]

My lack of lyrical awareness gets on my wife's nerves all the time, and I think it's the same reason I'm falling out of love with Taylor Swift as her last couple albums don't do anything for me. I can't vibe with them anymore. It's not like I'm listening to Red, or 1989, or Reputation, or Lover anymore. Those songs have beats, they have vibes, but this post isn't about Taylor.

One of my favorite songs ever - one that will 99% of the time put me to tears - has no words. It's beautiful; it's vibrant; it's emotional; it has no words. It's called ["Red Paper Lanterns"](https://song.link/us/i/1537796838) and it's by Maybeshewill.

This isn't to say there aren't songs that move me with their words! There are! Most [Owen songs](https://album.link/us/i/1651301892) strike chords with me with their words in addition to the lovely guitars. But the lyrics aren't the main event for me.

[^1]: The funny thing about this is that earlier in the day I saw this post come through my feed, I was making a mental note to go listen back to this AAF album.
[^2]: The difference is with my first album which was _very much a breakup album_, so...
