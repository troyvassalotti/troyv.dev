I got inspired to make my [now page](/now/) again for reasons I can't remember anymore as I type this out. Oops!

I also made a page for [sharing my running playlists](/running/) because I went on another long (7.41 mi) run today down to the harbor. It's cool to see what other runners are out there listening to, mainly because when I see what those playlists look like I usually think about how _different_ we are as people.
