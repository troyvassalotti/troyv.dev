"This Is Why We Don't Have A Podcast": a host talks to a different acquaintance every week for an hour on a podcast with no format. Together, they (and the audience) learn over this hour why they haven't already started a podcast through the awkwardness of talking to someone you don't know very well.

This assumes the two of you have known of each other for enough time that it's safe to say you'd already have been friends by now if it was meant to be.
