Websites are hard.

_Roll credits_.

I started this site in... (checks git history) I don't know, a few years ago.[^1] It's nice to think back on the initial designs and see how far I've come. The CSS, the performance, the **fonts**! Oh, the decisions a young, aspiring developer makes.

In 2020, I landed on the previous iteration of the site: a dark, straightforward blog focused heavily on optimized code. It suffered though from a lack of clear vision or goal, and over time it grew in complexity. That complexity wasn't so much seen from a viewer's perspective; however, I was feeling the quirks as the developer behind it.

My skills grew exponentially since 2020, what with me diving deeper into [Eleventy's](https://www.11ty.dev) features, building a few web components, and broadening my knowledge of how Node even works.
