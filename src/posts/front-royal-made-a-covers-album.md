We've been working on some new music this year. I promise we'll have an EP of new originals later this year, but we thought a collection of covers from last year's pop hits would be a fun way to hold everyone over.

You can find the entire set over [on our Bandcamp](https://frontroyalmd.bandcamp.com/) or streaming [on our website](https://www.frontroyalband.com). The hits include:

1. "cardigan" - Taylor Swift
2. "Afterglow" - Ed Sheeran
3. "Always Do" - The Kid Laroi
4. "Be Kind" - Marshmello & Halsey
5. "Hold On" - Justin Bieber

Thanks for listening, and be on the lookout for more later this year.
