I was surprised by how difficult it was to find a full-blown tutorial for making a Sudoku app with Vue. On the contrary, the internet is overflowing with React versions of Sudoku, so I decided to follow one of those and _port_ it into Vue.

Matt Biilmann of Netlify fame [made a Sudoku React app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GytUZLK4kwA) that can be found over on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel. This video was my entry point to my app, [Vuedoku](https://github.com/troyvassalotti/sudoku). I scaffolded it with Vite because I've been using that a lot lately.
