I'm finally getting around to reviewing my [ListenBrainz 2022 Year In Music](https://listenbrainz.org/user/actionhamilton/year-in-music/2022) and - to no one's surprise - it contains embarrassing results.

If you weren't aware, I was in a musical rut and thought it would revitalize my relationship with music by listening to [bands I purposefully avoided](https://www.thisisa.band/limp-bizkit/). This meant I spent months listening to the entire discographies of bands like Limp Bizkit, Korn, Pearl Jam, and more.

That experiment was initially aimed at bands I didn't think I'd like, but turned into bands I did like enough but wanted a deeper understanding of. This resulted in a year in music dominated by those experimented-on bands.

![A grid of my top nine albums, including Vasudeva, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Edamame, Their They're There, Taking Meds, Young Legionnaire, and Jawbox]({{ metadata.cloudinary.image }}/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:eco/v1646349103/blog/actionhamilton-top-albums-2022_x1cdpi.webp)

My top nine albums were:

1. Vasudeva - _Generator_
2. Korn - _Issues_
3. Limp Bizkit - _Still Sucks_
4. Edamame - _Periderm_
5. Their / They're / There - _Their / They're / Three_
6. Taking Meds - _Terrible News From Wonderful Men_
7. Young Legionnaire - _Zero Worship_
8. Limp Bizkit - _Significant Other_
9. Jawbox - _Jawbox_

> Note: I chose the top nine because that's how many albums fit on the image above.

Among that list, the Taking Meds, Their / They're / There, and Jawbox albums were my favorites by enjoyment. The Vasudeva and Edamame albums are perfect instrumental jams though, so check those out if you're into that sort of thing.

My top 10 artists are a slightly different story based on me listening to them a whole lot but not any particular album frequently enough.

![A list of my top 10 artists, including Korn, Limp Bizkit, Jimmy Eat World, Less Than Jake, Pearl Jam, Lower Than Atlantis, Bloc Party, Norma Jean, Jawbreaker, Edamame]({{ metadata.cloudinary.image }}/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:eco/v1646349103/blog/actionhamilton-top-artists-2022_oemttc.webp)

This list is influenced by me reading [Dan Ozzi's _Sellout_](https://www.danozzi.com/books/sellout) as you can tell by the Jimmy Eat World and Jawbreaker inclusions.

Other fun stats include Wednesdays being my most music-filled day, and listening to 1319 different artists. That last stat might be so high because I scrobble all my _passive_ listens too; if my phone detected a song while at the gym or the store, it would be scrobbled. I like this feature because it gives me insight into how much different music is around me without me actively knowing.

Did your 2022 year in music line up with mine at all? Let me know!
