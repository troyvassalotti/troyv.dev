You know that feeling when a song comes out and you can't believe it took this long in the history of music for a jam that good to be written?

Maybe it was a long awaited release, or you had no intention of listening to it willingly, but you heard it and it's here to stay...or so you think.

That happens to me a lot. I stumble upon a new artist or song, love it for weeks, add it to my current rotation, and then I forget about it.

Well, this year I'm keeping a playlist of these so-called _hits_: songs released in 2020 that I'm predicting to be my top songs of the year. At the end of the year, I'll give them a listen and see if they still hold up.

Follow along with the playlist here: [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5AmcQJOW59IhrSBRAg5mf0?si=4UlNcCIHSxGc3Y_9L0DliA](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5AmcQJOW59IhrSBRAg5mf0?si=4UlNcCIHSxGc3Y_9L0DliA)

Disclaimer: I realize songs released later in the year will have better chances of staying _hot_ in my head, but that's a bug I can't fix right now.
