As seen on a bike at the gym:

> Error is : 04-B0

I searched the internet for this code plus keywords related to workout bikes and got _nothing_. I didn't manage to get a picture of the bike this time, but I hope someone out there knows immediately what I'm talking about and can let me know what this means.
