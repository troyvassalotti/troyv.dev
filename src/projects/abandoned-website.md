> What if a website, left to wither away and be forgotten, actually looked abandoned over time?

That's a question I had in the early stages of my career journey. You know, because websites can be bought and live on forever - or so long as the domain name continues to be renewed - and some of them _don't age well_. So, I decided to bring a website to life that was designed to look forgotten in a modern way. Maybe some images are intentionally broken or things are naturally darkened as if the office's lights were cut off.

It was also my entry into using Hugo as a static site generator, which was my second SSG at the time of creation. I still don't think Hugo was the right tool for the job, but it got it done and that's all that matters.
