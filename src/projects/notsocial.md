You ever wish you had a social media platform that didn't consume your life, but still gave you entertainment? Look no further than NotSocial. We can all agree that social media is a lot to handle sometimes. I know I have a habit of scrolling on Reddit for far too long before I realize how long it's been, and it isn't isolated to Reddit. Twitter, Instagram, and the like are all in this bucket.

NotSocial isn't only an app; it's an ideology. You may be thinking that this is exactly the problem that other social media platforms have: they become more than an app and grow into a cultural phenomenon, and I'm not here to tell you whether you're right or wrong. But I am here to tell you how NotSocial is a new kind of social media platform where it is only you that exists in its world. It's a section of the internet for you - and only you - to be social with yourself while feeling connected with the rest of the world.
