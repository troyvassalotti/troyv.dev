			<h1>Okay, Great!</h1>
			<p>
				Look... Months ago, I started this silly little project thinking I'd
				create a cute website or app to showcase the story of our lives
				together; however, over time, that idea just didn't feel right.
			</p>
			<p>
				The more I thought about it, the more <em>unreal</em> it felt to take
				something as otherworldy as our love and transpose it into a load of
				code.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course if you're reading this then a website did in fact become some
				part of it, but here's the thing:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I hope it's still at least somewhat cute,</li>
				<li>
					I started something and did put <em>some</em> time into it, so I may
					as well have something to show for it,
				</li>
				<li>It'd be nice to distract you for a minute.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				I hope everything (this relationship, this night, this website) leading
				up to this point has been wonderful and totally not a disappointment in
				any way as that would surely ruin everything.
			</p>
			<h2>What Was My Original Plan, You Ask?</h2>
			<p>
				Well, I was going to create a storyboard of sorts, with select photos
				I've saved and highlights from our relationship and memories or passions
				we share together.
			</p>
			<p>
				But you see, trying to distill all that into a website felt so wrong, as
				I mentioned earlier. I didn't like trying to do that.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also realized just how many moments are uncaptured in photos or can't
				be retold in text on a screen. Think about it.
			</p>
			<p>The recurring thought I kept hearing was:</p>
			<blockquote>
				She's not going to like this. This isn't going to be enough. You can't
				take 3 years of the greatest times of your life with the most amazing
				person you've ever met, squash it all down into random bits of code and
				computer information, and have it convey your undying love the way you
				want it to.
			</blockquote>
			<p>So I'm only <b>partly</b> doing that.</p>
			<p>
				Instead, we hopefully had a nice dinner out on the waterfront in our new
				neighborhood, where we'll spend the next chapter of our lives together
				before packing up and moving on to our next exciting destination with
				our beloved cat <s>demons</s> daughters.
			</p>
			<p>And when we got home, I should have told you:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>How much I loved you,</li>
				<li>How important you are,</li>
				<li>
					How much you mean to me and everyone in the world you ever meet,
				</li>
				<li>And how I couldn't imagine living it with anyone else.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>The story continues...</h2>

					href="../question/"
