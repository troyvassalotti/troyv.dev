## What I'm Up To Now

Inspired by the [/now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about). If you'd like to know about my professional history,
you can [view my résumé](resume/). It's updated about as often as anyone else's résumé, but it looks nice and prints
well.

- Writing new music for [Front Royal](https://www.frontroyalband.com).
- Recording [troy.'s](https://justtroy.bandcamp.com) second album.
- Writing for [This is a Band](https://www.thisisa.band), a blog about bands.
- Creating the Digital Humanities Lab for [Goucher College](https://www.goucher.edu/).
- Binging all seasons of _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_ and _Lucifer_.
- Listening to a lot of podcasts on [code](hhttps://shoptalkshow.com/) and [Self Hosting](https://selfhosted.show/).
