## What I'm Up To Now

Inspired by the [/now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about). If you'd like to know about my professional history, you can view my résumé. It's updated about as often as anyone else's résumé, but it looks nice and prints
well. [Here it is](resume/).

- Recording [troy.'s](https://justtroy.bandcamp.com) second album.
- Writing for [This is a Band](https://www.thisisa.band), a blog about bands for people who want to share them.
